Version: 0.3.0
Date: 11-28-2025
  Major Features:
    - Major compatibility patch for Any Planet Start. (Currently Fulgora, Gleba, and Vulcanus are 100% implemented. Support for other modded planets is partially completed. Support for Aquilo, via Dredgeworks, is planned but has not yet been started.)
	- Wood can be accessed on Fulgora through the addition of Wooden Power Poles to Scrap Recycling.
	- Wood can be accessed on Vulcanus now that the Ash trees can be farmed.
  Minor Features:
    - Added compatibility with the mods "Wooden Vulcanus: Sulfuric Bacteria" and "Wooden Fulgora: Coralmium Agriculture" for even more wood on Fulgora and Vulcanus.

    - New Dependency: Factorio Data Standards Library (fdsl)

Version: 0.2.0
Date: 11-26-2025
  Features:
    - Added two new Recipes: Uncatalyzed Molten Iron and Uncatalyzed Molten Copper for a simpler but less resource-efficient method of smelting ores, closer to the vanilla experience but without requiring stone or calcite.
  Modding:
    - Full compatibility with Planetaris: Arig. Arig can be accessed without visiting Volcanus first if the crude foundry and crude big mining drill have been researched. Arig's advanced technology also (mostly) no longer requires metallurgic science packs.
  Balancing:
    - Adjusted stone byproduct of Purify Molten Iron/Copper to prevent an infinite stone source using the 50% base productivity of the Foundry (using productivity modules to generate free stone is fine, however).
    - Adjusted sand-related recipes to produce less byproduct sand.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed some recipe sorting issues
    - Fixed some item names and descriptions
    - Fixed some recipies showing in the "Total Raw" calculations incorrectly
