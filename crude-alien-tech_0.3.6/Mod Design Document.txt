Crude Alien Technology
	Description: Adds early-game versions of the Gleba, Fulgora, Vulcanus, and Aquilo production buildings while boosting the existing versions into more powerful Mk2 variants.
	
Optional Dependancies: 
	- Flare Stack Mod (for venting excess gasses)
	- Omega Drill (Makes Big Drill Mk1 a prerequisite for Omega Drill and buffs Omega Drill)
	- Any Planet Start (Reshuffles dependencies, unlocks Uranium and Nuclear Reactors on other planets
	- Planetaris: Arig (sand compatibility)
	
Unlocks a Mk1 version of the following buildings:
	- Electromagnetic Plant (1.5 crafting speed, 1.5MW electricity, 4 Module Slots, 5/m pollution, 20% Productivity)
	- Recycler (0.25 crafting speed, 150KW electricity, 3 Module Slots, 3/m pollution)

	- Agricultural Tower (5x5 grid, 80KW electricity)
	- Biochamber (1.5 crafting speed, 450KW nutrients, -0.5/m pollution, 3 Module Slots, 20% productivity)
	- Cryogenic Plant (1.5 crafting speed, 1.2 MW electricity, 7/m pollution, 6 module slots)
	
Upgrades the vanilla buildings into Mk2 variants:
	- EM Plant (2.6 crafting speed)
	- Recycler (0.65 crafting speed)
	- Foundry (5.2 crafting speed)
	- Big Mining Drill (41% resource drain)
	- Agricultural Tower (9x9 grid)
	- Biochamber (2.6 crafting speed)
